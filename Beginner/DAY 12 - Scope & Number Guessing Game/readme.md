# 1. Prime Number Checker
Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1.
Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)



You need to write a function called is_prime() that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.  It should return True or False.

e.g.

7 is a primer number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.

NOTE: 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and itself, but 1 is not a prime number because it is only divisible by 1.



Example Input 1

73

Example Output 1

True



Example Input 2

75

Example Output 2

False
