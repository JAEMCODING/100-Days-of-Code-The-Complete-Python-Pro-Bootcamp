# 1. PRINT
Write a program in main.py that prints the following notes on Python programming into the Output console. Your code should print all three lines.

Day 1 - Python Print Function

The function is declared like this:

print('what to print')

# 2. DEBUGGING PRACTICE
Look at the code in the code editor on the left. There are errors on all 4 lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.

# 3. INPUT FUNCTION
## 1)
Try this exercise to understand how tests work with inputs in Auditorium. Write some code that multiples together the two numbers in the input area. When you run the tests, different inputs will replace the ones in the input area and pass the new inputs through your code.

## 2)
Write a program that calculates and outputs the number of characters in any name. The automated tests will try out lots of different names as the input. Your code should work for any name.

# 4. VARIABLES
This program takes two inputs. The first input is stored in a variable called a. The second input is stored in a variable called b.

Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.

Warning . You don't need to print anything. The print statement is already in the template code. However, your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any value of a and b.
